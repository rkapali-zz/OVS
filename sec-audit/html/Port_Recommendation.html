<h2>Port Recommendation</h2>

<p>There are two way ports are opened, i.e locally and publicly. For local usage, ports such as ssh - 22(not recommended) , http - 80, https - 443, http(java) - 8080, https(java) -8443 , elastic head port - 9200, webmin ports - 10000, mysql - 3306 (not recommended) etc. can be open but publicly only 80 and 443 should be open.</p>

<p>In case you get a [WARNING] while scanning local IP, then those ports that are marked should be closed. In case of local IP scan, ports should be closed by shutting down the application that is invoking that port rather that using iptables.</p>

<p>In case you get a [WARNING] while scanning public IP, then those ports that are marked should be closed. In case of public IP scan, the ports are accessible from public areas so it should be closed either using iptables or in case of AWS, with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html">Security Groups</a>. </p>
